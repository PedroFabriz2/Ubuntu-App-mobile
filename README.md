TreeApp is an opportunity to contribute to the environment of the [3rd sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_sector) in Brazil. How? :point_down:


When we look around, there's a lot of people who wants to make the world a better place and just the fact of donating to NGOs and volunteering 
is a great way of helping changing the world. However, sometimes those people don't know how or where they can find good NGOs in a certain segment to donate.
TreeApp:palm_tree: can help...

## :iphone: the App


Basically, the App shows every necessity that registered NGOs(in our site) have. Example: "We are [_WorldFoodProgramme_](https://www.wfp.org/donate-now) and we are collecting food donations
to poor communities in Africa.

Anyone with the app installed can get in touch with the NGO (using email, whatsapp, instagram) or can donate some cash with [PicPay](https://www.picpay.com/site)
